# Pascal Language Parser
## Implementation of CYK and LR(1) parser in C

This program parses and validate the syntax of a Pascal Language source code.
If there is a syntax error, this program will also retrieve and show the cause of that error.

## Compiling
- Navigate to the 'bulid' directory.
- Run: 'make'

## Usage
- Navigate to the 'bulid' directory.
- Run: './parser <source_code_file_name>'

## Notes
- The 'cnf' folder inside 'build' contains all of the information about the grammar. Do not edit this.
